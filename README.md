# The-Shader-Grimoire

My personal archive of shader knowledge, resources, blog-style posts, and niche concepts. I grant you good power the same I do with bad power, so anything desclaimed as "Don't do this by the way lol" is my official warning.

I love optimization, I constantly study graphics and mathematics, and I hope to get you going on your next whimsical project.

# Sections

## [Did You Know?](./Sections/DidYouKnow.md)
I come across a lot of interesting things that people wouldn't easily come across, or things that make your life easier.

## [Dumping Grounds](./Sections/DumpingGrounds.md)

Either it doesn't need a whole write-up paper on the matter, or I'm too lazy to make a document for it quite yet, you'll find whatever is "miscellaneous" or up and coming here.

## [Owens Math Notes](./Sections/OwensMathNotes.md)

Don't expect any beginner friendly stuff in here. These are the math structures I deem worthy of actually writing down (meaning it took me much more than a week to conceptualize.) I see no point in keeping my notes as private, especially when I might be helping someone down the line!

## [Unity CRT](./Sections/UnityCRT.md)

I've rebuild the `UnityCustomRenderTexture.cginc` file from scratch. I've written a bit about how I came up with the shader code, and the comparisons between the original.

## [Easing Functions](./_InternalAssets/shader_functions/easings.hlsl)

Although there isn't a section on this one (yet), I spent roughly a week reinterpreting and fixing the [easings.net](easings.net) functions to work well in graphics.

# Amplify Developer?

Oh cool! I got you covered in a different project as well!
