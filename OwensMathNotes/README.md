# Owens Math Notes

As I figure things out in the wonderful world of math, I might post a roughly polished version of my notes for the world to see here! I won't guarantee them to be of stellar quality, since they're really meant for me to reference down the line, but feel free to read through them / gloss over and close the tab.

A lot of these notes are probably *not* beginner friendly, but if I'm going to spend months learning a topic, I see no point in gate keeping the knowledge. Feel free to come find me and ask.

Alright love ya, have a good day :purple_heart:
